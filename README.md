#Barrier to Entry

Temporarily, this project will be using Wii remotes for the part of hand tracking, including both orientation and position. Due to the nature of data/accuracy loss due to frame rate, it's highly unreliable. It works for the purposes of testing only, really. So for the time being, a number of scripts will be drawn up to utilize the Wii remotes though they are by no means effective enough for the project.

Also, this is a very professional readme. Top notch.
